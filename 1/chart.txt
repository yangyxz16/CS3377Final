C++:
# points	Time	Estimate value		Deviation	% error
10			3.32			0.474974	5.67888%
100			3.276			0.110923	4.27832%
1000			3.1336			0.0389543	0.254414%
10000			3.13764			0.0182344	0.125817%

1.3 I notice that the more points I try to run with, the more accurate the result is. I find out that in order to better accuracy, you need large data.
